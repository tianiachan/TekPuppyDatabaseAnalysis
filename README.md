# TekPuppyDatabaseAnalysis

Puppy adoption website hosted through Flask to help keep track of available dogs as as well as if they need a foster home in the mean time. 

### Technologies used:
VSCode: used for Flask and the web development
SQL Workbench: to visualize the database and make sure everything was getting uploaded
Jupyter Notebooks: to run the basic analysis

### Instructions to run
1. Git pull everything down to a local folder
2. Create a config.py file that contains your username and password with those as variable names and have it saved in the main folder for this to run.
3. Run through the Analysis python file either with [Jupyter Notebook through Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). This will create the beginning database as well as fill in the database with starting information.
4. Through the terminal in VS code, type "python puppydb.py" to launch the website through Flask. Some extra installation of python packages may be needed. Use pip install to install said packages and then it should run locally.
